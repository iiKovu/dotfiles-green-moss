AI: There are several ways to check RAM speed on Linux. Here are a few methods:

1. **glxinfo**: This command displays information about the X Window System, including the amount of physical memory (RAM) available in each swap space.
```
glxinfo | more
```
This will show you the total amount of RAM (in GB), the amount used by the graphics card, and other details.

2. **free -m**: This command displays detailed information about the system's usage, including the amount of physical memory (RAM) in each swap space.
```
free -m
```
This will show you the total amount of RAM, the amount used by the kernel, and other details.

3. **meminfo**: This command displays a table of system resources, including the amount of physical memory (RAM).
```
grep Mem /proc/meminfo | tail
```
This will display the amount of RAM in each swap space. Note that this command only works on systems with swap partitions.

4. **top -h mem**: This command displays information about the CPU and memory usage, including the amount of physical memory (RAM).
```
top -h mem
```
This will show you the current usage of the system's resources, including RAM.

5. **lsblk -o size -j -d -s**: This command displays a table of disk devices, including the amount of free space on each device in bytes.
```
lsblk -o size -j -d -s
```
This will show you the total amount of physical memory (RAM) for each device.

6. **memtest86+**: You can also use this command to test the RAM speed by running a 4GB loopback test on multiple devices.
```bash
memtest86+
```
You'll need to run this command in a terminal, and it will report back the number of memory errors encountered during testing.

These are just a few methods to check RAM speed on Linux. Each method provides different information about your system's resources, so you can choose the one that best suits your needs.

Me: how can I check ram speed on linux?
AI: To check the RAM speed on Linux, you have a few options. Here are some of them:

1. **Command: `free -m`**: This command is part of the `free` utility and shows information about all running processes, including memory usage. By default, it displays only general system statistics. You can enable detailed information by adding `-s` to the end of the command.

    ```bash
    free -m
    ```

2. **Command: `cat /proc/meminfo`**: This command provides detailed information about memory usage. It shows fields like `total`, `used`, `available`, and `shared`. To display only RAM speed, you can use a combination of the `free` command with `grep`.

    ```bash
    free -m | grep "MemTotal"
    ```

3. **Command: `htop`**: Htop is a more advanced tool for managing processes and memory usage. You can also use it to monitor RAM speed.

    ```
    htop
    ```

4. **Command: `glance ram` (for Glance) or `psutil info ps"` (for psutil)**

    These commands provide detailed information about process memory usage, including RAM speed.

    ```bash
    glance ram
    ```

   ```bash
    psutil info ps
    ```
